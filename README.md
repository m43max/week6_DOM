### Week 6 "Document Object Model" project

For week 6 of phase 0, we had to make an interactive website using JavaScript
and the DOM. I made a simple "Brick Breaker" game, using this
[MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) as a guide.
